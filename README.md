# Courses@CRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021

Slow-paced 4-day containers and Nextflow course for beginners.

## About the course

Linux containers allow the storage of code and applications in an host-independent lightweight environment. They became a fast and popular way to share and deploy applications in different environments.
Nextflow is a powerful polyglot workflow language that, coupled with Docker and Singularity containers, provides a robust, scalable and reproducible way to run computational pipelines.

### Outline

The 4-day Containers and Nextflow course will train participants to use and build Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines.
It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions, while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.
The course will be fully virtual via the Zoom platform.
Trainees will work in  a dedicated AWS Cloud9 environment.

### Learning objectives

About containers:
* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line.
* Build Docker container from an existing recipe.
* Design/Write a Docker recipe.
* Convert Docker to Singularity image.

About Nextflow:
* Locate and fetch Nextflow pipelines from dedicated repositories.
* Execute/Run a Nextflow pipeline.
* Describe and explain Nextflow's basic concepts.
* Test and modify a Nextflow pipeline.
* Implement short blocks of code into a Nextflow pipeline.
* Develop a Nextflow pipeline from scratch.

### Prerequisite

Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment. Applicants are not expected to have used neither Linux containers nor Nextflow workflows before.

## Preliminary program

### Day 1 & 2: Containers

#### Day 1: Docker

* Containers: introduction and history.
* Docker hub: find existing containers.
* Fetch (and build) an image from Docker hub.
* Run Docker container based on an existing image (also run it interactively).
* Work with volumes.
* Build image from existing recipe:
  * Explain sections.
  * Build options (e.g. cache).
* Write Docker recipe and build image from it.
* Upload image to Docker hub.

#### Day 2: Singularity

* Singularity versus Docker.
* Fetch (and build) Singularity from Docker hub.
* Run Singularity container (interactively).
* Work with volumes.
* Build Singularity image from existing recipe (?).

### Day 3 & 4: Nextflow

#### Day 3: Fetch, understand, run, modify

* Nextflow pipeline repositories (e.g. nf-core).
  * hands-on: fetch X pipeline.
* Run an existing Nextflow pipeline.
* Understand Nextflow main files (main.nf and config files).
* Basic concepts:
  * Processes and channels
* Nextflow configuration files.
* Modify and run a Nextflow pipeline.

#### Day 4: Write and share

* Write Nextflow pipeline from scratch.
* Run Nextflow with containers.
* Run Nextflow in computing cluster (e.g. HPC).
* Share Nextflow pipeline.
