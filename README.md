# Courses@CRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021

Slow-paced 4-day containers and Nextflow course for beginners.

## About the course

### Outline

The 4-day Containers and Nextflow course will train participants to use and build Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines.<br>
It is designed to provide trainees with short and frequent hands-on sessions, while keeping theoretical sessions to a minimum.<br>
The course will be fully virtual via the Zoom platform.<br>
Trainees will work with the dedicated AWS Cloud9 environment.

### Learning objectives

About containers:
* Locate and fetch Docker/Singularity images from dedicated repositories
* Execute/Run a Docker/Singularity container from the command line
* Design/Write a Docker recipe
* Build Docker container from a recipe
* Convert Docker to Singularity image

About Nextflow:
* Locate and fetch Nextflow pipelines from dedicated repositories
* Execute/Run a Nextflow pipeline
* Describe and explain Nextflow's basic concepts
* Test and modify Nextflow pipeline 
* Implement short piece of code into a Nextflow pipeline
* Develop Nextflow pipeline from scratch

### Prerequisite

Being comfortable working with the CLI (command-line interface) in a Linux-based environment.

## Preliminary program

### Day 1 & 2: Containers

* Containers: introduction and history

#### Day 1: Docker

* Docker hub
* Fetch (and build) image from Docker hub
* Run container (interactively)
* Build image from recipe:
  * Explain sections
  * Build options (e.g. cache)
* Working with volumes
* Upload image to Docker hub

#### Day 2: Singularity

* Singularity versus Docker
* Fetch (and build) Singularity from Docker hub
* Run Singularity container (interactively)
* Working with volumes

### Day 3 & 4: Nextflow

#### Day 3: Fetch and run

* Nextflow pipeline repositories (e.g. nf-core)
  * hands-on: fetch X pipeline
* Run a Nextflow pipeline
* Basic concepts:
  * Processes and channels
* Modify a Nextflow pipeline
* Nextflow configuration files

#### Day 4: Build and share
